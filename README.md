# Picsart Gallery AppA responsive React app for browsing high-quality photos from the[Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/). Built with TypeScript, Vite, andtested with Jest.## Features- Responsive masonry grid layout- Lazy-loading with `IntersectionObserver` for smooth performance- Detail view with photographer info and full-size images- Search for stunning photos by keyword- Fully tested (unit + integration) with 90%+ test coverage## Tech Stack- **React 19 + TypeScript**- **Vite** for fast bundling- **React Router v7**- **Jest** and **React Testing Library**- **Pexels API** for image data- **IntersectionObserver** for lazy image loading- **CSS modules** for scoped styling---## Project Structure```src/├── api/               # Pexels API logic├── components/        # UI components (PhotoCard, MasonryGrid, etc.)    └── __tests__/     # Unit tests├── types/             # TypeScript types├── utils/             # Helper functions and env loader├── App.tsx            # Main app logic├── main.tsx           # Entry point└── setupTests.ts      # Jest setup + polyfills```---## Getting Started### 1. Clone the repo```bashgit clone https://github.com/aranit/picsart.gitcd picsart```### 2. Install dependencies```bashnpm install```### 3. Setup environmentCreate a `.env` file with your Pexels API key:```envVITE_PEXELS_API_KEY=your-pexels-api-key```### 4. Run the dev server```bashnpm run dev```### 5. Run tests```bashnpm run test```### 6. Build for production```bashnpm run build```---## Design Decisions### 1. **Lazy Loading with IntersectionObserver**To optimize image-heavy rendering. `ImageObserver` delays rendering until inview. This reduces DOM nodes and improves scroll performance.### 2. **Infinite Scroll**We detect when users scroll near the bottom and fetch additional photos via`useEffect` + scroll position. Throttling via a `useRef` flag ensures noredundant API calls.### 3. **Test Coverage**The app includes unit tests for all core components, including error boundaries.### 4. **Environment Agnostic**We use `getPexelsApiKey()` utility to handle Vite's `import.meta.env` duringdevelopment and `process.env` during testing.---## Performance Techniques- **Lazy Image Rendering:** Defers loading images not currently in viewport- **Batched Infinite Scroll:** Avoids duplicate fetches with `isFetching` guard- **Minimal re-renders:** `useCallback` and memoized props- **Fast builds:** Vite handles optimized hot-reloads and build performance---## Testing Overview- Jest + React Testing Library- `setupTests.ts` includes `TextEncoder`, `TextDecoder`, and  `IntersectionObserver` mocks- Coverage collection is enabled via `collectCoverageFrom`
